1) 100000 NUMBER should be in ascending form and in sequential in file handling = sortedno.java
2) program for 100000 random number in file handling                            = fileA.java
3) program for 100000 random and unique number in file handling                 = randuniq.java

1) linear search in file data                                                   = LinearSFile.java
2) time complexity of linear search (int start_time= System.currentTime() = end =total end - start; = linearSearchWithTimeComplexcity.java
3) Binary search in file numbers data        (use arraylist<Integer> tag        =________.java

4) insertion sort (in file handling , also print time complaxcity of it)       = ______.java
